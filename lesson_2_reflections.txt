1.	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
it?

All your files show up as not tracked.  This needs to be done so that
you can choose which items should be tracked.  You might have contents in the
folder you might not want tracked, because it will never change from
revision to revision of code.  This also keeps the software from allocating
space for these items that will never change in the repository everytime you
commit.

2.  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows the user to choose which files to commit.  It is a
location for choosing which files from the working directory to the
repository.  This is valuable, because you can commit part of the files if you
mess up on one file.  Then you can recheck out the master without worrying
about missing anything you might have changed.
