1.	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
it?

All your files show up as not tracked.  This needs to be done so that
you can choose which items should be tracked.  You might have contents in the
folder you might not want tracked, because it will never change from
revision to revision of code.  This also keeps the software from allocating
space for these items that will never change in the repository everytime you commit.
