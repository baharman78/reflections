1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository could be used if you want to just make changes to non code files,
such as the ReadMe file or a flow chart.  This way you wouldn't need your local
machine to work on planning your code.  You could also just coordinate with other people working on
on planning your open source project.
