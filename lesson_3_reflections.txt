1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A remote repository could be used if you want to just make changes to non code
files, such as the ReadMe file or a flow chart.  This way you wouldn't need your
local machine to work on planning your code.  You could also just coordinate
with other people working on planning out your open source project.

2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This could be problematic, because you could be making changes on your local
machine that haven't been pushed to the remote repository.  If someone else did
a push on your remote repository, then you would lose all of your work.

3.  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

This is beneficial, because then you know exactly what the state of the
remote repository is before you try to run commands that might affect it.

4.  How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be
easier, and what would be harder?

If I would collaborate without Git or GitHub, then I would just use email to
send code files back and forth.  GitHub is much easier to collaborate with
someone else, and gives an easy way of keeping record of all changes.  There
really isn't anything that would be harder by using Github and Git.
