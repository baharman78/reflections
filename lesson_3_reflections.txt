1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A remote repository could be used if you want to just make changes to non code
files, such as the ReadMe file or a flow chart.  This way you wouldn't need your
local machine to work on planning your code.  You could also just coordinate
with other people working on planning out your open source project.

2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This could be problematic, because you could be making changes on your local
machine that haven't been pushed to the remote repository.  If someone else did
a push on your remote repository, then you would lose all of your work.
